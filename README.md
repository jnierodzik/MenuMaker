<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![product-screenshot]

As an avid whiskey drinker I found that cataloging my collection was rather easy with spreadsheets and other pre-existing tools. What I lacked though was a way to elegantly present it to friends and family that would visit and thus the MenuMaker Project was born.

I wanted to create a tool that would take a common data source and automate the menu creation suporting:
* Page spanning
* Header insertion
* Multiple data points (Brand, Expression, Distillery, Proof)
* Iconography labels (Bottled in Bond, Barrel Proof, Wheated)

Of course, no one menu will serve all since your needs and spirit of choice may be different. So I'll be adding working to make the script more open to changes in the future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

To see the whole menu, as of January 2020, check out the [gallery](https://imgur.com/gallery/c8WXLgU)
